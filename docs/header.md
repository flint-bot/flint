# node-flint (v4)

### Bot SDK for Node JS

## News

**2/22/17 IMPORTANT:**

* Note that Flint v4 is still using the node-sparky library version 3.1.19.
  However the repo for node-sparky is now on version 4 which has some major
  differences. This misalignment between Flint and Sparky version
  will be fixed in the next several months with the release of Flint v5. In the
  short term if you are accessing the spark object directly from Flint via
  `flint.spark` be sure to use the documentation for [node-sparky 3.1.19](https://github.com/flint-bot/sparky/tree/bcfe307a6b90f8ad3d26837c2bc06e48eb6328f4).   

**See [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes to versions of Flint.**
