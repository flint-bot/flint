# node-flint (v5)

### Spark Bot SDK for Node JS

## News

**x/x/x IMPORTANT:**

* Flint v5 is a huge refactor from v4. Before upgrading your existing bots to
use v5, please make sure to review all docs and examples to understand the new
class methods and library structure.

* Flint no longer supports tokens from non Bot Accounts. This has become
necessary due to the various difference between a bot and person token.
Additionally Cisco does not support nor endorse using a person token for bots.
Applications that require this function should be defined as a "App"
integration. If you are looking for a framework that uses a "person" token and
integrates easier into "App" integrations, check out node-sparky.

**See [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md) for details on changes to versions of Flint.**
